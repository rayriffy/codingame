Statement

### Goal

You are an Archwizard defending your city from the last onslaught of ogres. You excel in casting massive explosion spells which can inflict apocalyptic damage. Unfortunately you only have enough mana to cast one explosion spell of size `n`*`n`, which after casting will render you immobile. Given an `m`*`m` battleground littered with hordes of ogres, find greatest number of casualties you can devastate with the single explosion spell.

### Input

**First line:** one integer `n` which is the size of your explosion spell.

**Next line:** one integer `m` which is the size of the battleground.

**Next `m` lines:** the floor plan of the battleground, where '.' is empty space and 'x' is a horde of ogres

### Output

The maximum number of hordes you can destroy with one explosion spell.

### Constraints

0 < p, n, m <= 10
